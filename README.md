Notepad++ Maven Distribution
----------------------------

This project republishes official Notepad++ distributions in a form consumable from Maven Central.

For information about Notepad++ itself, please see the upstream project [npp](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus)

## Motivation

Notepad++ does not currently publish artifacts to Maven Central.  
This project exists to provide a Maven-friendly distribution for build systems and environments that rely on Maven repositories, without altering the upstream software.

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Notepad++ project.
